# Stopwatch
Max MSP integration.

### Requirement
The Stopwatch is written in NodeJS, so you need to install both NodeJS and npm from their respective website. This software is supposed to work in all operating systems.

### Setup
Open stopWatch.maxpat and click on script start.
You can now open your browser with all the devices connected to the same network and follow the address printed in Max.

### WebSocket
The default WebSocket server's port is set to ```8081```. You can change its value on line 30 of ```server.js``` but remember to change it also on line 1 of ```public/client.js```

### OSC capabilities
coming soon...
