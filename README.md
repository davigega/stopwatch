# Stopwatch
a tcp osc streaming stopwatch

### Requirement
The Stopwatch is written in NodeJS, so you need to install both NodeJS and npm from their respective website. This software is supposed to work in all operating systems.

### Setup
After you clone the repository, or download as zip, use a terminal, or a shell in Windows to ```cd``` into it and install the dependencies:
```shell
$ cd /path/to/folder/stopwatch
$ npm install
```
then simply start the server with:
```shell
$ npm start
```
if everything was set up correctly you should see a message saying:
```shell
Connect to:
192.168.0.110:8080
```
or similar. You can now open your browser wih all the devices connected to the same network and visit the page ```192.168.0.110:8080``` and simply use the website as graphical user interface.

### OSC capabilities
